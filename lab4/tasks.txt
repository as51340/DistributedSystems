The business logic allows consumers to retrieve and reserve available shows and seats,
and managers to discover the best performing shows and most loyal clients. Through the Spring Boot
middleware, you can quickly set up and launch your application. You will enforce the elevated privileges of
managers by implementing authentication and authorization through Firebase Authentication.

To improve
scalability and guarantee high availability, you will use indirect communication through Cloud Pub/Sub to
decouple reservation processing from other back-end tasks, all while maintaining all-or-nothing semantics.
You will ensure that the platform is fault tolerant even when relying on an unreliable service. Finally,
while your application runs primarily locally for test purposes, the interaction with external services and
the division of tasks between different processes and services already makes it a distributed system.


Once authenticated in the browser, the web application will send an OAuth Identity token containing the
userâ€™s identity and attributes to the /authenticate endpoint. Token has been sent from login.js script to authenticate.

TODO return book and try to reserve for the last 15days of January.
XML namespaces: we use it to avoid collision within different XML fragments.
We can define in ihe XML fragment and then this is applied to all children
with the same prefix.

e.g
<h:table xlmns:h="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">
.
.
.
</h:table>

Or we can also define in the root:
<root xlmns:h="...">
  <h:table>
  .
  .
  .
  </h:table>

XML schema descibes the structure of XML document, also referred to as XSD.
  - the number of elements and attributes that can appear in a document
  - data types
  - restrictions on some elements and attributes
  - specify default value..
  - validate correctness of data
  - it is easier to describe allowed document content
  - easier conversion between data types
  - define data patterns
  - you can use existing XML parser

XHR request - XMLHttpRequest

XML Schema complexType - XML element that contains other elements and/or attributes.

Restrictions on XML elements are called facets.
But which child element should appear in the sequence???

1. In XML Schema why do we use tns:meal in requests but meal specify under xs
namespace?
2. But which child element should appear in the sequence??? For sequence XSD element.
3. Repeat what is Bean? Component bla bla...
4. What target namespace do we have to define??? Why exactly foodservice.io...	I think we can define any.
5. What is SOAP transport style?? Is this explained within answer what is SOAP binding.


curl -X POST localhost:8080/ws -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -H "Accept: application/xml" -d request.xml

Additional questions:
1. HTTP POST method is used.
2. Content-length is 791 and Content-typw is text/xml
3. 200 OK is still returned is I ask for non-existing meal and 404 is I ask for non-existing SOAP operation
4. Transport is set to https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http"/ and binding to http protocol localhost:8080/ws. WSDL is IDL for services:
   a) Contains type definitions as XML schemas
   b) What messages can be received/sent.
   c) Port type defines an interface - the set of operations offered by one or more endpoints
   d) Binding should specify which transport protocol should be used.
   e) Service - defines an offered service, collection of related ports.
